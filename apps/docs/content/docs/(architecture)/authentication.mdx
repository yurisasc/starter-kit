This starter kit features a secure, scalable, and decoupled authentication architecture powered by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/). This guide explains the overall design and the separation of concerns between the Auth Server and Resource Servers.

## Architecture: Decoupled Auth Server

Instead of embedding authentication logic within the main API server, this project uses a dedicated, standalone **Auth Server** (`apps/auth`). All other backend servers (like `apps/api` and `apps/mcp`) are considered **Resource Servers**.

This separation provides several advantages:

*   **Single Responsibility**: The Auth Server does one thing and does it well: authenticating users and issuing tokens.
*   **Scalability**: The Auth Server can be scaled independently of the resource servers.
*   **Security**: Resource servers don't need access to user credentials or session secrets. They only need to know how to validate a token.

### Auth Server Responsibilities

The Auth Server is the central authority for user identity and authentication. Its primary duties include:

- Handling user registration, login, logout, and password management.
- Managing user sessions and issuing authentication tokens.
- Providing public keys (via JWKS endpoint) for token verification.
- Storing user data in a secure database.

The Auth Server operates independently and does not contain any domain-specific business logic.

### Resource Server Responsibilities

Resource Servers focus solely on their domain functionality, such as API endpoints or MCP services. They delegate all authentication concerns to the Auth Server:

- Receiving and validating JWT tokens from clients.
- Fetching and caching public keys from the Auth Server's JWKS endpoint for token verification.
- Denying access to unauthorized requests.

This allows Resource Servers to remain lightweight and focused on their core purposes.

### Server Interaction

Communication between the Auth Server and Resource Servers is stateless and secure:

- Clients authenticate with the Auth Server to obtain JWTs.
- Clients include JWTs in requests to Resource Servers.
- Resource Servers verify JWT signatures using keys from the Auth Server.

This decoupled design enables easy scaling, independent deployments, and enhanced security by isolating authentication logic.
