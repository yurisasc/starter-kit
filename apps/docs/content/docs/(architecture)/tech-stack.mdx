## Overview

This section outlines the key technologies used in this starter kit, along with the reasoning behind 
each choice. The tech stack is designed to prioritize type safety, developer experience, performance, 
and maintainability.

## Authentication

### Better Auth

**Why [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)?**
- Free, self-hostable and open-source
- Modern, secure authentication library with excellent TypeScript support
- Supports multiple authentication methods (email/password, OAuth, etc.)
- Extensible plugin system for additional features

**Usage**: Authentication and session management.

<Callout type="tip">
**Alternatives**: Due to the [decoupled architecture](/authentication#architecture-decoupled-auth-server), 
the Auth Server can be replaced with managed auth services like Clerk, Auth0, or Firebase Auth, which 
provide JWKS endpoints for JWT validation.

See [Authentication](authentication#replacing-the-auth-server-with-managed-services) for details on 
replacing the Auth Server.
</Callout>

## Backend Frameworks

### Hono

**Why [Hono](https://hono.dev/)?**
- Lightweight and high-performance web framework
- Excellent TypeScript support with full type inference
- Built-in middleware system for authentication, logging, etc.
- Minimalist API that's easy to learn and extend

**Usage**: Framework for the Auth and API servers.

<Callout type="info">
**Framework Flexibility**: Due to the [decoupled architecture](/authentication#architecture-decoupled-auth-server), 
resource servers can use any framework (e.g., NestJS, FastAPI, Gin, Rails), as long as they validate JWTs via JWKS. 
Note that non-JS frameworks may not work with Turborepo and Drizzle ORM is JS-based, so other languages connect 
directly to PostgreSQL using their own database libraries.
</Callout>

### FastMCP

**Why [FastMCP](https://fastmcp.com/)?**
- Specialized framework for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Optimized for AI agent integration
- Lightweight and focused on RPC-style tool exposure
- Demonstrates integration of non-Hono servers into the architecture

**Usage**: Framework for the MCP server.

## Database & Data

### PostgreSQL

**Why [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/)?**
- Robust, enterprise-grade relational database
- Excellent JSON support for flexible data modeling
- Strong ACID compliance and transactional integrity
- Mature ecosystem with excellent tooling and community support

**Usage**: Primary database for all data persistence.

### Drizzle ORM

**Why [Drizzle](https://drizzle.team/)?**
- Better Auth integration for automatic schema generation
- Generates TypeScript types from database schema
- Lightweight with zero runtime overhead
- Excellent migration system with Drizzle Kit

**Usage**: Database ORM and query builder.

## API Documentation

### Scalar

**Why [Scalar](https://scalar.com/)?**
- Beautiful, interactive API documentation
- Auto-generates from OpenAPI specs
- Built-in API testing capabilities
- Modern UI that's easy to navigate and understand

**Usage**: API documentation interface.

## Development Tools

### Docker

**Why [Docker](https://docker.com/)?**
- Consistent development environments across machines
- Easy database setup and teardown
- Containerized development workflow
- Simplifies onboarding for new developers

**Usage**: Running PostgreSQL database in development. Will be used as one of the deployment options for 
the whole stack.

### Drizzle Studio

**Why [Drizzle Studio](https://drizzle.studio/)?**
- Visual database interface for development
- Query execution and schema exploration
- Real-time database introspection
- Integrated with Drizzle ORM for seamless workflow

**Usage**: Database GUI for development and debugging.
