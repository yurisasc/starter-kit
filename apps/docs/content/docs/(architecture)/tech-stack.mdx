## Overview

This section outlines the key technologies used in this starter kit, along with the reasoning behind 
each choice. The tech stack is designed to prioritize type safety, developer experience, performance, 
and maintainability.

## Authentication

### Better Auth

**Why [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)?**
- Free, self-hostable and open-source
- Modern, secure authentication library with excellent TypeScript support
- Supports multiple authentication methods (email/password, OAuth, etc.)
- Extensible plugin system for additional features

**Usage**: Authentication and session management.

<Callout type="tip">
**Alternatives**: The decoupled architecture supports any authentication service that issues JWTs with a 
JWKS endpoint,
including managed services like Clerk, Auth0, or Firebase Auth. Resource servers can validate JWTs from 
these services
by fetching their public keys, making authentication provider choice flexible.
</Callout>

## Backend Frameworks

The decoupled architecture provides flexibility in framework choice.
Resource servers only need to validate JWTs by calling the Auth server's JWKS endpoint, making the stack 
framework-agnostic.

<Callout type="info">
**Framework Flexibility**

Due to the decoupled design, resource servers can use any framework or language that can validate JWTs.
For example, NestJS, Python FastAPI, Go Gin, or Ruby on Rails.

**Key Requirements:**
- Fetch JWKS from the Auth server
- Verify JWT signatures

**Notes:**
- Non-JavaScript frameworks may not integrate seamlessly with Turborepo's build system
- The ORM choice (Drizzle) remains JavaScript-based
- Other languages can connect directly to PostgreSQL using their own database libraries
</Callout>

### Hono

**Why [Hono](https://hono.dev/)?**
- Lightweight and high-performance web framework
- Excellent TypeScript support with full type inference
- Built-in middleware system for authentication, logging, etc.
- Minimalist API that's easy to learn and extend

**Usage**: Framework for the Auth and API servers.

### FastMCP

**Why [FastMCP](https://fastmcp.com/)?**
- Specialized framework for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Optimized for AI agent integration
- Lightweight and focused on RPC-style tool exposure
- Demonstrates integration of non-Hono servers into the architecture

**Usage**: Framework for the MCP server.

## Database & Data

### PostgreSQL

**Why [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/)?**
- Robust, enterprise-grade relational database
- Excellent JSON support for flexible data modeling
- Strong ACID compliance and transactional integrity
- Mature ecosystem with excellent tooling and community support

**Usage**: Primary database for all data persistence.

### Drizzle ORM

**Why [Drizzle](https://drizzle.team/)?**
- Better Auth integration for automatic schema generation
- Generates TypeScript types from database schema
- Lightweight with zero runtime overhead
- Excellent migration system with Drizzle Kit

**Usage**: Database ORM and query builder.

## API Documentation

### Scalar

**Why [Scalar](https://scalar.com/)?**
- Beautiful, interactive API documentation
- Auto-generates from OpenAPI specs
- Built-in API testing capabilities
- Modern UI that's easy to navigate and understand

**Usage**: API documentation interface.

## Development Tools

### Docker

**Why [Docker](https://docker.com/)?**
- Consistent development environments across machines
- Easy database setup and teardown
- Containerized development workflow
- Simplifies onboarding for new developers

**Usage**: Running PostgreSQL database in development. Will be used as one of the deployment options for 
the whole stack.

### Drizzle Studio

**Why [Drizzle Studio](https://drizzle.studio/)?**
- Visual database interface for development
- Query execution and schema exploration
- Real-time database introspection
- Integrated with Drizzle ORM for seamless workflow

**Usage**: Database GUI for development and debugging.
