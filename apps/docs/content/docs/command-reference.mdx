pnpm dev:app
```

pnpm lint

# Auto-fix linting and formatting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Run TypeScript type checking across all packages

```

## Database

```bash
# Generate auth schema from Better Auth config
pnpm db:schema

# Generate a new SQL migration from schema changes
pnpm db:generate

# Apply all pending migrations to the database
