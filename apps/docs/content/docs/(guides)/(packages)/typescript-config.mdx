**Location**: `packages/typescript-config`

## Purpose

This package contains shared `tsconfig.json` base files. Different applications (e.g., a Next.js app vs. a Node.js server) may require slightly different TypeScript settings. This package provides a set of common, strict base configurations that other projects can extend.
