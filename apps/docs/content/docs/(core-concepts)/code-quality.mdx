## Overview

This project enforces a high standard of code and commit quality through a series of automated tools and 
workflows. This ensures consistency, readability, and a stable codebase.

## Static Analysis

Static analysis tools check your code for errors and style issues without running it.

*   **Biome**: Used for both linting (finding potential bugs) and formatting (enforcing a consistent 
code style). The configuration is centralized in the `@repo/biome-config` package, ensuring all code in 
the monorepo looks and feels the same.
*   **TypeScript**: Shared `tsconfig.json` files in the `@repo/typescript-config` package provide a 
strict, consistent set of compiler rules for all projects.

## Automated Quality Gates

To ensure that no low-quality code enters the main branch, we use automated checks that run before every 
commit.

### The Pre-commit Hook

This is powered by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), a tool that makes it easy to manage Git 
hooks. The configuration in `.husky/pre-commit` specifies a set of commands that must pass before a 
commit is allowed:

1.  **`pnpm lint-staged`**: This command runs `biome check --write` on all staged files. It 
automatically formats your code and checks for linting errors.
2.  **`pnpm typecheck`**: This runs the TypeScript compiler across the entire project to ensure there 
are no type errors.

If either of these steps fails, the commit is aborted, giving you a chance to fix the issues.

### Commit Message Hygiene

We use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce the [Conventional 
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
This means your commit messages must follow a standard format, like:

```
feat: add user profile page

fix(auth): correct validation logic for email sign-up

chore: update dependencies
```

This practice creates a clean, readable, and easily searchable Git history, and it enables automated 
tools to generate changelogs.
