This guide covers common issues you may encounter while setting up or running the project.

### Invalid Environment Variables

*   **Error**: `Invalid environment variables` on startup.
*   **Solution**: Make sure you have a `.env` file in each requiring project, and that all required variables are set. See [Quick Start](/docs/installation) for more information.

### Database Connection Failure

*   **Error**: `Cannot connect to database` or `ECONNREFUSED`.
*   **Solution**: Make sure your PostgreSQL Docker container is running (`docker ps`). If not, start it with `docker start auth-postgres`.

### Port Conflicts

*   **Error**: `Port 3001 already in use`.
*   **Solution**: Another process is using the required port. Find and stop it (`lsof -i :3001`), or change the `PORT` in the appropriate `.env` file.

### Migration Errors

*   **Error**: `Migration failed` or `relation already exists`.
*   **Solution**: For development, the easiest fix is often to reset the database by dropping and recreating it in Docker, then re-running `pnpm db:migrate`.
