## Overview

This starter kit provides a solid foundation, but it is designed to be extended. Here are some ways the 
project structure might evolve.

## Adding a Web Frontend

A common next step is to add a web application (e.g., a Next.js or Remix app) that consumes the `api` 
server.

*   **Location**: A new directory would be created at `apps/web`.
*   **Authentication**: The web app would interact with the `auth` server to handle user sign-in and 
session management.
*   **API Consumption**: It would make authenticated requests to the `api` server by first requesting a 
JWT from the `auth` server,
as outlined in the authentication architecture.

## Adding a Mobile App

The architecture is already designed to support a mobile client.

*   **Location**: A new directory could be created at `apps/mobile` for an Expo or React Native project.
*   **Authentication**: The mobile app would use a token-based flow, storing session tokens securely and 
requesting JWTs for API calls.

## Adding More Shared Packages

As the project grows, you might extract more shared logic into the `packages/` directory.

*   **Example**: A `@repo/ui` package could be created to share React components between the `docs` site 
and a new `web` application.
*   **Example**: A `@repo/utils` package could house common utility functions used by multiple backend 
services.
