## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive, full-stack monorepo designed to provide a robust foundation
for building modern applications with a focus on type-safety, scalability, and developer experience.

## Who is this for?

This starter kit is for developers who want to:

*   Quickly bootstrap a new project with a solid, production-ready architecture.
*   Learn best practices for building applications with TypeScript, Hono, Drizzle ORM,
and other modern tools.
*   Understand how to structure and manage a complex project using a monorepo.

## Core Philosophy

This project is built on a set of core principles.
These principles guide our architectural decisions for the codebase:

*   **Type Safety**: Code must be type-safe at compile time and runtime.
*   **Schema as Code**: Database schemas are version-controlled and generated from code.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: A clear boundary between applications (`apps`)
and shared libraries (`packages`).
*   **Documentation as Code**: APIs and workflows are documented as part of the development process.

## For AI and LLMs

This documentation is also available in formats optimized for AI consumption:

*   **Full Documentation**: A single [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) file containing the entire 
documentation in plain text.
*   **Per-Page MDX**: Per-page LLM MDX at `/llms.mdx/[page-slug]` (e.g., `/docs/auth` â†’ `/llms.mdx/auth`).
*   **Copy Markdown**: Each page also has a "Copy Markdown" button
that provides plain text ready for LLMs.
