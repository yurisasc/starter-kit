This project is a comprehensive, full-stack monorepo designed to provide a robust foundation for building modern applications with a focus on type-safety, scalability, and developer experience.

## Who is this for?

This starter kit is for developers who want to:

*   Quickly bootstrap a new project with a solid, production-ready architecture.
*   Learn best practices for building applications with TypeScript, Hono, Drizzle ORM, and other modern tools.
*   Understand how to structure and manage a complex project using a monorepo.

## Core Philosophy

This project is built on a set of core principles. These principles guide our architectural decisions for the codebase:

*   **Type Safety**: Code must be type-safe at compile time and runtime.
*   **Schema as Code**: Database schemas are version-controlled and generated from code.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: A clear boundary between applications (`apps`) and shared libraries (`packages`).
*   **Documentation as Code**: APIs and workflows are documented as part of the development process.
